Image Processing and Classification Model for Screening Mammography in Automated Detection of Breast Cancer 

In this groundbreaking project, we developed an innovative machine learning model to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection using mammography images. Our work focused on addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets, typical in medical imaging. By applying sophisticated image preprocessing techniques, including Region of Interest (ROI) cropping and data augmentation, we significantly improved the model's ability to distinguish between malignant and benign cases. Our model utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), specifically the ResNeXt architecture, and experimented with Visual Transformers (ViT), ultimately achieving impressive performance metrics. This project represents a substantial step forward in automated medical diagnosis, offering potential benefits in early cancer detection and healthcare efficiency.
